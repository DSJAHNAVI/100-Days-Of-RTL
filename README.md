# 100-Days-Of-RTL
Hello VLSI enthusiasts. I'm DS Jahnavi, and I'm now focused on RTL Design with Verilog HDL as I immerse myself in the world of VLSI. I use Intel's Quartus (Quartus prime 17.1) and Modelsim to synthesize and simulate RTL codes as I work towards my 100-day objective of learning RTL.
