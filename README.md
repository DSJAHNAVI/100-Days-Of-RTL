# 100-Days-Of-RTL
Hello VLSI enthusiasts. I'm DS Jahnavi, and I'm now focused on RTL design with Verilog HDL as I immerse myself in the world of VLSI. I use Intel's Quartus (Quartus prime 17.1) and Modelsim to synthesise and simulate RTL codes as I work towards my 100-day objective of learning RTL. 

Day-1: Modeling styles in Verilog

Day-2: Half Adder and Full Adder

Day-3: Half Subtractor and Full Subtractor

Day-4: Full Adder using Half Adder & Full subractor using Half subractor

Day-5: HA,FA,HS,FS using nand gate
